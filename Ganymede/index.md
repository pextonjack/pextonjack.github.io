## Privacy Policy:

Effective Date: 05/10/2024

We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how data is collected and used when you interact with our mobile game. While we do not directly collect or store any personal information, third-party service providers that we integrate into our game may do so. Specifically, we use ironSource with Unity LevelPlay for advertising services. The personal data collected by these third parties is managed by them, and we do not have access to this information.

### Third-Party Data Collection

Our game integrates with ironSource, which may collect and process data such as:

- Device identifiers (like IDFA), but only if explicit consent is given
- IP address
- Interaction data (such as ad impressions and clicks)

This data is used for purposes such as serving personalised ads, optimisation, and fraud prevention. We encourage you to review ironSourceâ€™s full privacy policy for more detailed information on how they handle your data.

For more information on how ironSource processes your data, please refer to their privacy policy.

### Data Rights

Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, or delete the personal data that is collected by third parties like ironSource. You can manage your privacy settings on your device by following the relevant instructions provided by the platform you are using:

- iOS: Go to Settings > Privacy & Security > Tracking.

If you have any concerns or requests regarding your data, you can contact ironSource directly.

### Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with the updated date.
